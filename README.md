# neo360alert
A Chrome add-on to ensure you don't miss client alerts

Neo 360 can be set up with alerts in the Client Diary. However this only appears as a red ! and if you're in a hurry, it might be easy to miss it.  This browser extension looks for the red ! and fires up a popup alert.

This was a one-off project for a client and was my first and only Chrome extension.
